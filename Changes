Revision history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Test-ReportPrereqs

{{$NEXT}}

  [Changed]

  - Test file generation split in two.  The test file is gathered early and
    is available for analysis/munging by other plugins.  The static
    dependency data is saved into another file late (after prereqs are
    finalized).  The test file loads the static data at runtime.  This
    should make this plugin validate with [VerifyPhases].

  - Test report format now splits out report by phase and type.  This means
    that "Test Requires" are distinct from "Runtime Requires" and if there
    are different versions required for each phase, those are visible in
    the report.

  [Changed]

  - Embeds the complete static prerequisite hash into the
    generated file; no longer creates just a static list
    (that varied based on AUTHOR_TESTING);

  [Changed]

  - Modifies the test file with the static prerequisite list

    the AfterBuild phase (Kent Fredric)

  [Added]

  - New 'include' and 'exclude' attributes may be used to add additional

  [Fixed]

  - Optional CPAN::Meta requirement of generated test file is now
